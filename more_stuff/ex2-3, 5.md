# Exercise 2
1) An error because you need the .call method attached to the block within
the execute definition

wrong - this will still run as you've passed a block to the method. but since 
the method is not doing anything with the block it just returns without printing

need to add .call to also invoke that block vs returning the block as an object

# Exercise 3
Process to identify and trace the source of an error in a block of code
Helps to identify root cause of errors and location in code

misread the question - answered what is stack trace & error messaging

exception handling is being/resue/end (Ruby) try/except(Python), etc.
accounting for errors in code to prevent it from crashing

# Exercise 5
Did not use & in method definition
