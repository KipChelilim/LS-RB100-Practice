# Exercise 7
An array is an ordered list with an index, a hash is a list of key-value pairs
that does not maintain on order (later versions of Ruby now maintain order)

# Exercise 10
Yes to both.
hash with array keys: {:name, ["John", Doe"]}
array with hashses [{:"first" => "John", :"last" => "Doe"}, {:"first" => "Jane", :"last" => "Smith"}]

# Exercise 15
These hashes are not the same!
WRONG! I was thinking no because they are different points in memory vs
equivalency

in other words:
  Was Correct: these are two different objects in memory with their own
  object_ids which will yield false if you use the .equal? method

  Was Wrong: these two are not different and WILL yield true if evaluating their
  equivalency through eql or ==
