Exercise 7:

A hash was closed with a paren ')'  instead of curly bracket '}' which threw up an error.

After reading solution: not guaranteed to be a hash. Could've been a code block or string interpolation.
Also, not guaranteed that paren was used in place of bracket. Could've been a missing bracket and paren was just the next closing character recognized.
