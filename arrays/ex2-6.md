# Exercise 2
-1) [[b, 1],[b, 2],[b, 3],[a, 1],[a, 2],[a, 3]]
    [[b],[b, 2],[b, 3],[a, 1],[a, 2],[a, 3]]

-2) [ [b, [[1, 2, 3]]],[a, [[1, 2, 3]]] ]

    #so array brackets around Array method did not create a nested array with 1
    item. no, based on video it did. but product removed it? noooo it took the
    new_array[0] which is a single array not nested. extra brackets not needed
    
# Exercise 3
-1) arr[1][0]

# Exercise 4
-1) 3
-2) error
-1) 8

# Exercise 5

-a) "m"
-b) " " 
-c) "!"
all wrong, counted from 1 instead of 0
should be "A", "o", and nil because 19 is outside range

# Exercise 6
-1) names["margaret"] returns in the index instead of specifying the index to
    change. change to names[3] = ...
    or if you don't know the position -> names[names.index["margaret]] = ...
